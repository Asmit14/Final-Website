1. What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)<br>
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems<br><br>

2. Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?<br>
HTTP is called as a stateless protocol because each request is executed independently, without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it, which means once the transaction ends the connection between the brows
<br><br>
3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP<br>

The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).<br>
The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.<br>
The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data as well as any relevant data.<br>

4. Describe the parameters on a get and post request.<br>
Both GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client to server in HTTP protocol but Main difference between POST and GET method is that GET carries request parameter appended in URL string while POST carries request parameter in message body which makes it more secure way of transferring data from client to server in http protocol.<br><br>

5. What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?.<br>
HTTP status code 200 - the request has succeeded.<br>
HTTP status code 404 - the server was unable to find the requested resource.<br><br>

6. What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.<br>
An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server. Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser — keeping a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol
<br><br>
7. Why are cookies a security issue?<br>
Since the data in cookies doesn't change, cookies themselves aren't harmful. They can't infect computers with viruses or other malware. However, some cyberattacks can hijack cookies and enable access to your browsing sessions. The danger lies in their ability to track individuals' browsing histories.<br><br>

8. Describe session hijacking and XSS<br>
Session hijacking is an attack where a user session is taken over by an attacker. A session starts when you log into a service, for example your banking application, and ends when you log out. The attack relies on the attacker’s knowledge of your session cookie, so it is also called cookie hijacking or cookie side-jacking. Although any computer session could be hijacked, session hijacking most commonly applies to browser sessions and web applications.<br><br>


9. Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)<br><br>
Cross site request forgery (CSRF), also known as XSRF, Sea Surf or Session Riding, is an attack vector that tricks a web browser into executing an unwanted action in an application to which a user is logged in. A successful CSRF attack can be devastating for both the business and user.<br><br>

10. What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?<br>

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources.<br><br>
